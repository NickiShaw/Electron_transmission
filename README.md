This repository contains a script to recreate Fig. 8 from:
> Dwyer, J. R.; Harb, M. Through a Window, Brightly: A Review of Selected Nanofabricated Thin-Film Platforms for Spectroscopy, Imaging, and Detection. Appl. Spectrosc. 2017, 71 (9), 2051–2075.

The data for these calculations are taken from:
> Riley M.E., MacCallum C.J., Biggs F. “Theoretical Electron-Atom Elastic Scattering Cross Sections: Selected Elements, 1 keV to 256 keV”. _At. Data Nucl. Data Tables_ 1975; 15(5): 443–476.

and provided for selected elements in the file `TotalCS_SelectedElements.csv`.

Moleuclar weight information for all elements are given in `PeriodicInfo.csv`.
